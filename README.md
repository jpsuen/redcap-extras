redcap-extras
=============

This fork of the SUSOM redcap-extras project is designed to provide the REDCap functionality required for the DoD PASTOR project.  This project provides the following adaptations from the main project:

  - The addition of the DVPRS scale - More info: at the [Defense & Veterans Pain Rating Scale](http://www.dvcipm.org/clinical-resources/pain-rating-scale)
  - The ability to indicate whether an imagemap should allow single vs multiple clicks.  (e.g. Select ALL the areas with pain VS Select the ONE area with the MOST pain)
