redcap-extras
=============

This fork of the [SUSOM redcap-extras](https://github.com/susom/redcap-extras) project is designed to provide the REDCap functionality required for the [DoD Pain Assessment Screening Tool & Outcomes Registry - PASTOR](http://www.dvcipm.org/clinical-resources/pain-assessment-screening-tool-and-outcomes-registry-pastor) project.  This project provides the following adaptations from the main project:

  - The addition of the [Defense & Veterans Pain Rating Scale](http://www.dvcipm.org/clinical-resources/pain-rating-scale)
  - The ability to indicate whether an imagemap should allow single vs multiple clicks.  (e.g. Select ALL the areas with pain VS Select the ONE area with the MOST pain)
